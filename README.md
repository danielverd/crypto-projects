# crypto-projects

A collection of cryptographic projects based on work done in CSC609 Data Security and Cryptography at the University of Miami.
The code in this repository is meant only to demonstrate my understanding of cryptographic concepts. I am in no way asserting that these programs represent a robust cryptographic system. If you are implementing a cryptographic system, please use an already implemented robust cryptographic system.

BozhuAES - a modified version of the AES encryption box found at https://github.com/bozhu/AES-Python. This implementation of AES is used because it does not include the modes of operation, which I will be implementing from scratch.
